// daemon — the loop that makes this run for hours instead of for one session.
//
// One tick: read every open PR at a pinned head, publish a verdict, decide the
// single next action, and act within capacity. Everything it learns is written
// to the store, so a restart resumes rather than restarting.
//
// Two properties are deliberate and they are the whole point:
//
//   · The halt switch fails CLOSED. A marker file stops the loop AND terminates
//     workers in flight. The previous system's hooks all ended in `|| true`,
//     which is the opposite: every failure was swallowed and the session
//     continued as if healthy.
//   · Execution is OPT-IN. By default a tick observes, publishes and reports what
//     it WOULD do. Shipping a loop that acts before its decisions have been
//     watched is how an unattended run becomes an incident.
